#SciCollab
##by Garon Bailey

##User Stories
SciCollab was made from a mindset that the world of science is a little closed off. Many people within the same field meet at conferences, and they may even be working on similar research projects. If a researcher in Alabama meets a researcher from France, it is hard to keep up with the research until it reaches publication. It is designed with the idea of seeing updates and data as it's being collected. 

Additionally, if two people are separated but want to collect data for the same project, they should be able to update each other in a manner that is far more visual than simply emailing Excel sheets back and forth. With SciCollab, it will be open and visible for approved people to see, and even more selectively for people to update with their own data.

##Future Updates
This is an expansive project to reach its full potential. For starters, I would like to make projects private or open. I would like for researchers to add other researchers to a connections list to more easily add them to be allowed to view or collaborate on a project. I would like to be able to search and sort both researchers and projects by their field, category, and subcategories.

Far more in depth, I would like to make the addition of data and the creation of charts, plots, and graphs far more flexible than I had time to code originally. The use of the charting javascript library is flexible on its own, but to code it into the forms and controllers is an extremely time-consuming undertaking.

##Acknowledgements
The graphs, charts, and plots were created with the open-source plotly.js JavaScript library, which can be found [here at plot.ly](https://plot.ly/api/).
Built on Node.js, ExpressJS, and MongoDB.
